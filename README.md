# Introduction
#### Goal: Calculating every forces which effect movement of Cart&Pole, turning the forces into equations and control the cart to maintain the pole vertically balanced.

This project is executed in 2014, by ACUS LAB(AeroSpace Control & Unmanned System) in Hanseo University. Uploading for recording purpose.
